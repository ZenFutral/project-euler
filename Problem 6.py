# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1^2) + (2^2) +...+ (10^2) = 385
# 
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, 
# (1 + 2 +...+ 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
# 
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
